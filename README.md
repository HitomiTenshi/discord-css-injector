# Discord CSS Injector
Save a folder with this script somewhere where you won't move it again (the "custom.css" file will be loaded everytime you start / reload Discord).

Re-run the script, whenever discord decides to update and throw away your css injection code.

# How to run
Execute `npm install` once to load dependencies and then just run `npm start` whenever needed to setup the code for css injection.
